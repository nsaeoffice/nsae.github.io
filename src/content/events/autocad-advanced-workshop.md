## About This Workshop

This intensive 3-day workshop is designed for civil engineers looking to upgrade their skills from 2D drafting to complex 3D modeling.

### Learning Outcomes

1. Understanding coordinate systems in 3D.
2. Surface vs. Solid modeling.
3. Rendering and visualization techniques.

Please bring your own laptop with AutoCAD 2022 or later installed.
